# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms

This project was developed as part of a college assignment for the Operating System course. It implements five different scheduling algorithms.

## Overview

The project consists of two main classes:
- `Process`: Represents a process with attributes such as process ID, arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.
- `Scheduler`: Implements the scheduling algorithms and calculates performance metrics for each algorithm.

## Implemented Scheduling Algorithms

1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**
2. **Round Robin**
3. **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
4. **Priority (Non-preemptive)**
5. **Priority (Preemptive)**

## Data Structures
Various data structures were employed to ensure a well-implemented solution.

## Performance Metrics

The project calculates the following performance metrics for each scheduling algorithm:
- Waiting Time
- Turnaround Time
- Completion Time

Additionally, the average turnaround time and waiting time across all processes are computed.
